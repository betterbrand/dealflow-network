# Project Rules

## Git
- NEVER mention Claude, Anthropic, or AI in commits, PRs, or comments
- Always create a PR vs. pushing to main
- Always start new work on a new branch
- Ask developer to test locally before creating a PR
- Get approval for commit messages and PR descriptions

## Style
- Use "updated" or "added to" for profiles, never "enrich"
- Never use emoji

## Planning
Before implementation, discuss:
- Target users
- Benefit to those users
- Success criteria
- Expected user experience when complete

Be concise. Explain concepts assuming limited technical context.
